# FirstRPG
First ever game, made with gamemaker studio 2 in high school

Welcome to this pixelated world, a preset map on which you evolve containing a main and sub boss, shops, monsters, treasures and even an invisible labyrinth in a cave (good luck).
We used royalty free 8bit versions of songs we love to accompany you on this (short) journey with one of our many classes (including a beggar).
Really simplistic game for sure, but still a dear one to me.

Can't update most of the files though, too heavy, mostly there as a memory for the future.
